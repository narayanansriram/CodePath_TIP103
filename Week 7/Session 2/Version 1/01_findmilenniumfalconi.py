# Han Solo's ship, the Millenium Falcon, has broken down and he's searching for a specific replacement part. As a repair shop owner helping him out, write a function check_stock() that takes in a sorted list inventory where each element is an integer ID of a part you stock in your shop, and an integer part_id representing the integer ID of the part Han Solo is looking for. Return True if the part_id is in inventory and False otherwise.

# Your solution must have O(log n) time complexity.

def check_stock(inventory, part_id):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(inventory)-1
    while lo<=hi:
        mid = lo + (hi-lo)//2
        if inventory[mid]>part_id:
            hi = mid-1
        elif inventory[mid]<part_id:
            lo = mid+1
        else:
            return True
    return False

# Example Usage:

print(check_stock([1, 2, 5, 12, 20], 20))
print(check_stock([1, 2, 5, 12, 20], 100))

# Example Ouput:

True
False
